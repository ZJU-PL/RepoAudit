        "(1) You should choose the most likely callee function from the list of candidate callee functions. In most of cases, you should choose only one callee function. If you do not know which one is the most likely one, you can choose multiple ones. Make sure that the number of the callee functions you choose is as small as possible. BUT you MUST choose AT LEAST one callee function.\n",
        "(2) The parameter names of a candidate callee function and the argument names at the call site in the caller function can show important clues for you. If they show more similar high-level semantic intent, the callee function is more likely to be the correct one. \n",
